filter will return a new array
Arrow function will make the job easy
reduce will take the function as parameter( function's previous value and next value)

reduce(preval,nextval)=> preval+=nextval,10

10 adds to preval


array destructuring
[a,b]=[b,a]

difference between oop programming and functional programming

functional programming-1903's
relay on functions rather than objects


callback functions-


declarative functions 

imperative functions

template literals=${a}

class Main{
   * static * display(shape){
        console.log('area of ${shape} is ${shape.calulateArea()}');
    }
}
if static is removed then we have to create a object for that function
new Main().display(new Rectangle(23.4,34.5))


toString will be implicitly called whenever the object is called

defAULT module can be imported using any name 


modularity is a key (organising)
module bundler-to bind everything into single js file
webpack-load your modules and bundle everything
1)package.json=define all dependencies

npm init --y
npm install --save-dev webpack
run webpack
or
npx webpack
npx webpack init
2)htmlwebpackplugin

node dist/main
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin

npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin

plugins:[new HtmlWebpackPlugin()],
in webpack.config.js is important
